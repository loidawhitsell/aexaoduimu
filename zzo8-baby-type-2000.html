                            <p> Let me start by saying this is the list of books that \ \ I enjoyed\ \ . I'm not saying that #1 is better than #10, I'm simply saying I enjoyed it more. Not all of these books have crazy symbolism and story arcs and deep character/world building, some of them were just fun reads. I have read nearly every classic science fiction book available, and a lot of contemporary and non-classics as well. Also, a disclaimer: there is no cyberpunk in here, no Stephenson or Gibson. Edit: Mods, let me know if I need to remove this-- This post also exists in a prettier format with images and such on my video game blog (https://backlogcrusader.blog/2019/04/29/why-do-so-many-female-gamers-play-support-characters/) along with in depth game reviews and other gamer culture thoughts. If you liked this post, I will be posting a lot more like it on my site over the next few months. I posted a less polished version of these ideas on /r/overwatch about two years Greetings all! Well Mother's Day has come and gone once again. Children of all types have spent the day annoying their mother's enough that she is pleased to see them either leave, or go back to their old routines and just leave her to her peace. Ahhh. Now I am not a mother myself, but if you have read my first ever post on Reddit then you all have at least heard of my mother. If not then let me tell you a tale. One of bratty kids, an over worked mother.and her revenge. Sit back, relax. Hey there everyone! I often see people asking where to start when getting into prog metal, so I thought instead of answering every one of them individually I'd make a list. I'm not going into too much depth because otherwise this will become endless, but I'll try to give a brief explanation of all styles I'm going over. So let's get started! #Part 0: Some information on the genre and motivation Since this guide got as huge as it did, I felt it was necessary to write a better introd. 
My earliest memories were of living the American dream. I was the youngest child in a family of 4. We went to church on Sundays, my mother putting me in fancy dresses with ribbons and bows. We had a nice three bedroom house, with a backyard and a front yard, a swimming pool, a family dog, and a tree that I could climb. All we were missing was a white picket fence. My mother, a former school teacher, had quit her job to homeschool my brother and me. I remember hot summer days hanging out around. https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/988/288/03a These games i cherish deeply and i can play for hours, these are games i consider QUALITY and what every game should strive for, these are games that if i had to pick 10 PC games for the rest of my life, i would pick these. ------ #1 Diablo Why? The original is such a delight, i love the sprites, the soundtrack, this game was dark souls before dark souls, i love the rougelike element. The feeling of hopelessness. Typical. # Intro Hey there, fellow indie game dev. Let’s cut to the chase: you’ve got a game that you've either just started working on, or maybe it’s already late in production and you need to start building its home on Steam, or maybe your page already exists but it could use some improvement. Whatever the case, you want your Steam page to be as efficient as possible, bringing in good traffic and converting it into wishlists and ultimately sales. I’m going to try and use what experience I’ve gained. Welcome, Adventurers! We've been hard at work testing all the characters and items in Ooo and we've come up with a few changes that we think will make the game more fun for everyone. Many characters who were weaker than they should have been have been made stronger, while others who were a little too powerful have been scaled back. Here's a full list of what's changed: # Balance Changes General Musical instrument weapons no longer apply their boosts to all characters Hi ladies! I finally finished college and now have no clue what to do with my time  so I decided I would compile all of my TB finds that's I've collected. I tried to not include tooooo many of the commonly posted items, and all links should be working! Please let me know if there are any issues or wrong links :-) Also, sorry for all of the annoying commentary lmao I need to shut up side note: does anyone get a high off of finding things on tb? Like I don't even have to order them, finding. 
The courts have thrown away even the smallest kernel of truth in favor of out right gynocracy and feminazism and it is not just women judges. 1. " In 2000, one of Ontario’s senior family judges, Justice Steinberg, said: “When parties engage in sexual relations, they are deemed to do so on the understanding that however unlikely and however unanticipated, a pregnancy may result.” Two years later, Justice Backhouse of the Ontario Superior Court added: “Relationships involve risk taking.

I had posted a month or so before on Craigslist looking for a house to rent, a bit away from the Strip so I'd have somewhere to relax. I ended up making 1) Fluoride is the only chemical added to water for the purpose of medical treatment  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) classifies fluoride as a drug ( when used to prevent or mitigate disease (FDA 2000). As a matter of basic logic, adding fluoride to water for the sole purpose of preventing tooth decay (a non-waterborne disease) is a form of medical treatment. All other water treatment chemicals are added to improve the water. >"Years ago, when I was a boy," said Dorian Gray, crushing the flower in his hand, "you met me, flattered me, and taught me to be vain of my good looks. One day you introduced me to a friend of yours, who explained to me the wonder of youth, and you finished a portrait of me that revealed to me the wonder of beauty. In a mad moment that, even now, I don't know whether I regret or not, I made a wish, perhaps you would call it a prayer." >-The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde-. (Hey guys, I’m still kind of learning the ropes of Reddit. I didn’t know you had to wait a week if you wanted to post partial stories, but I did get a message saying I can add the second post to this post. So this is going to be long, and I’m sorry I didn’t get to see most of your questions/comments on the last post since it was deleted 😕 ) so for a TLDR- I spent a year in a haunted house that effected all six of us living there. Also, if anyone knows if my post isn’t within the guidelines. 1) Fluoride is the only chemical added to water for the purpose of medical treatment .

I usually post some advice here each New Year to assist new and improvng swimmers, and people hoping to use swimming for exercise and weight management. Swimming is a sport that when done consistently will allow you to pursue it for an entire lifetime and reward you for doing do. /r/swimming is a great resource, especially if you use the search bar, as there is almost no questi.

We finally made the long-awaited sequel to our favorite spring break in Panama City Beach, Florida. Only now we weren't hard-partying FSU students. Instead, we were twenty-nine and settled down in the suburbs. Married with full-time teaching jobs. And parents as well. Yeah, we loved Sam and Carol.

This just happened, and I'm just sitting in a bathroom stall shaking in anger and shock, I don't know how to react to this, I'm not a confrontational person but I'm so sorry if my thoughts aren't very clear in this post: Background story: I failed health class back in 2015, because the teacher I had at the time, required us to do physical stuff, like dress out in rediculously tight uniforms and run laps, do the FitnessGram Pacer Test etc. So my school's cirriculum requires this class to gradu. Another post, oh boy. I've found Reddit is a pretty good vent place and I'm not using my usual internet name or my real name so those losers can't track me down and harass me. About my second maybe third year in that awful American high school, should I mention it's racist against all nationalities that aren't white or Mexican? Because I got shit for being the one Japanese girl in the entire school. Poor Korean girl too. Hope she ended up better than I did. I had a history class </p>
