My friend says that the Aerial jump was changed from Cross to Gen. He was "sliding" off the monster in Gen, causing him to slide/not jump off the monster. He was very clear about saying that he never had that problem in Cross and is now having problems with jumping off monsters in Gen. As far as I can tell, MHGen is just a localization of MHX; there shouldn't be any weird changes like this, right? In terms of mechanics, MHGen should just be MHX in English/other languages. 
The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time is considered to be one of the greatest games of all time, due in large part to the seamless unity between traditional Zelda gameplay and the bold, artistic, 3D environment in which it is presented.

Hello again everyone. If you remember I posted a thread (https://www.reddit.com/r/MarioMaker/comments/4rnnst/send_links_to_your_levels_with_7_15_clear_rate/?sort=topampst=iqz45a12ampsh=c69162ab) about 3 weeks ago asking for levels. I received lots and I've played all of them. The process of picking my personal top 8 levels from that thread have been lot of time put into it and therefor it took this long for me to come up with an answer. Method: I played three levels at a time and wrote. –ö–Ω–∏–≥–∏, –≤–∏–¥–µ–æ, –∞—É–¥–∏–æ, –ø—Ä–µ—Å—Å–∞, –º–∞–Ω–≥–∞ –∏ –∫–æ–º–∏–∫—Å—ã, —Ñ–∞–Ω-–∞—Ä—Ç, —à—Ä–∏—Ñ—Ç—ã, —Å–ø—Ä–∞–π—Ç—ã, –º–æ–¥–µ–ª–∏ –∏ —Ç.–ø. This ( thread from assemblergames discusses possible locations of the Ura Zelda disk for the Nintendo 64 Disk Drive. A few comments down, a user named "Kao" comments an image of a Nintendo archive bulding where Ura Zelda may be located. According to Kao, this building was "their active headquarters during Ocarina of Time's development," so it seems like a reasonable location. I did a little bit more information on this exact image very interesting, are there any notes on what the OPT values do? Or how to properly load any of the cut scenes? are the codes for floating with L the same from the main game? thank you for your work brucy love the site here, consider a discord. Welcome back to the Fire Emblem Essay Contest! Since I just had a massive history test yesterday, today's topic will be about in-game history! The prompt is as follows: Choose a world from any Fire Emblem game, and analyze the lore of that world based on its impact on the games in that world. These essays will be due sometime at the end of the month. I'll post reminders about it too for those participating, although it's never too late to join. My only real rule is that you should avoid.

Hi all, I've been working on setting GLupeN64 up today. There have some bumps along the way but it's all mostly working now. My only problem is with savestates. I'm using the December 29th x86-64 Windows (I'm on Windows 10) nightly of Retroarch, and I also went and tried to update GLupeN64 through the core updater inside Retroarch around maybe 5 minutes ago. I have savestates set to save to slot #0 (while trying to debug this I made damn sure it was set to explicitly save there so I could.
