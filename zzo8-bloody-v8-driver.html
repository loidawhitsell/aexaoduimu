I had half a mind to write up something about my Bathurst 12 hour experience due to the somewhat unique nature of it, but when Cookie asked me about it in last weeks MOTM I thought I'd better put aside some time to do it. So here we go, my Bathurst 12 hour experience, one week later. --- Bathurst is one of those places that's almost mythical.

Pizza Delivery Diaries vol.5. The Gruesome Deception “Are you alright?” I asked with notable apprehensiveness. Sgt Holden, one of the men that was sent out to protect and watch over me, was cocking his head to the left.

Anointed with Piz Buin and ordained by magical thinking. God save our royal family! ( Sunday Times , Jan. 27) If we'd never had any sort of government and suddenly decided we needed one, it's highly unlikely we'd come up with a system where the position of head of state was hereditary. Imagine trying to sell the notion on Question Time. Not even the brilliant and eloquent Diane Abbott could hope to make it fly. It's nuts that Prince Charles is going to be our next leader simply.

So, before we start, I have a confession to make. When I started following Formula 1 in 1982, at the ripe age of 5, my dad gave me a magazine he had bought when he discovered that mum was pregnant again. He already had a daughter (aka my older sister) and he was sure it would be a boy. So he bought an F1 magazine previewing the 1976 season (I would be born in September - New Year’s Eve was great for my mum and dad apparently.). When I started watching the races with him, he gave me the magaz.

In the past few weeks we've witnessed some interesting developments regarding the future of Formula 1, most notably the unveiling of the first draft for the 2021+ power unit regulations, which included the removal of the MGU-H. None of the current OEMs reacted positively to its removal, whilst prospective OEMs, like Cosworth, strangely found a liking to them. We on r/f1 have been clamoring for its removal for three years, but when u/F1_research posted the thread regarding the new engine regulati.

Well, I guess I’ll be here for a while. So, let's get started. It all began with the American Legend. The Icon. One of the most recognized names in automobile history. The Corvette. Yeah, this car is what dreams are made of. I mean, I have always been a “car guy” - just not the wrench turning type. A global leader of computer peripherals such as keyboard, mice, web camera, wireless products and gaming. PURE SPOILERS I've seen it over 20 times. Enough to pick just a section of the screen to watch for details. Yeah, I have a rich and fascinating life. General comment: kudos to the continuity team. I really don't see any continuity issues (eg: a broken mirror that miraculously repairs from cut to cut). Inside Max's Interceptor car door are three animal skulls.

It is supposed to be a club where anyone can come and talk about cars, display their cars and car ideas and go over the pros and cons of each make and model in a mature environment. The problem is, the club is run by Ford fans almost exclusively.

So just over a year ago now, I was frustrated with the lack of content on the feeder series of Formula 1 on reddit in general. Except for the odd subreddit like /r/GP2, there just wasn't anything. So I created the subreddit /r/F1FeederSeries so people can track the worlds finest talents all the way to Formula 1, instead of wondering "who these bloody pay drivers?" are all the time. Joking aside, this time last year, to start the subreddit off for the first GP2 weekend, I created 'An Intro. Bloody Gaming - Bound by Passion. Bound by Innovation. Bound by Gaming. 'cuz I sure as hell am not one of them and it's pissing me off. This headset worked flawlessly for a month. Then the infamous three beeps amp green flashing started happening. I wasted so much time searching for a solution and it seems there isn't one. It's a fantastic headset and I would really love for it to work as it has everything I need in a headset, but I'm sick and tired of it simply because I can't use it for more than sometimes even twenty bloody seconds before it turns itself. For  the A4Tech Bloody Gun3 Headshot V8 is definitely a steal, especially with the bundled Ultra Core 3 software suite which unlocks its potential.

James May is thinking about buying a Volvo. He says it's like going to the dentist, something you have to do at some point, so you may as well get it over with. Happily, I have been to the dentist regularly over the years. I'm now on my third - or is it fourth? - XC90, so as the years advance and my knees begin to ache, I can be a bit more adventurous with my choice of car. Not that long ago, I'd have bought a Jaguar.
