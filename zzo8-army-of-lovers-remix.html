Between introducing the video broadcast of A State Of Trance to the radio studio set-up and hosting several phenomenal ASOT events in places such as Utrecht in the Netherlands, Melbourne in Australia, Gliwice in Poland and more, we got to introduc. Im always down for a weird music share-fest. I've met more people here who share some of my strange musical taste that it's got me in an awesome sharing mood! Show me what you've got! (Please mark youtube links NSFW if they are as fair warning) I'm gonna start by making a list here for you all: First a small section of fan created songs for an indie horror game called Bendy and the Ink Machine.

Art is the greatest healer! To understand the music r/INFJ likes and loves, I searched for "music" on the searchbar and pulled out some of the songs people have posted there. This is a list of about 214 12” singles, 11 10” singles and a couple of 7” singles. The focus is on club music that was filling clubs in London in 1981-1985, with a particular emphasis on: newly emerging electro-funk (including the first bits of hip-hop) mostly coming out of NY and DC cross-over between post-punk and dance, that typically filled the Camden Palace thursday night gig, the Anvil and related London clubs remixes of non-disco dance stuff from that period UK electro Rank: #1: OutKast – Hey Ya!, 9.168, 935.1 #2: LCD Soundsystem - All My Friends, 9.128, 931.1 #3: Sufjan Stevens – Chicago, 9.125, 930.8 #4: Arcade Fire – Neighborhood #1 (Tunnels), 9.023, 920.3 #5: Radiohead – Idioteque, 9.018, 919.8 #6: Radiohead – Everything in Its Right Place, 8.825, 900.1 #7: The Avalanches – Since I Left You, 8.806, 898.2 #8: Animal Collective – My Girls, 8.773, 894.8 #9: M.I.A. – Paper Planes, 8.696, 887.0 #10: Franz Ferdinand – Take Me Out, 8.563, 873.4 #11: LCD Soundsyst.

This is the first r/indieheads rate of individual songs/singles and not albums, and boy are we starting off with a bang. We're taking the top 50 songs from Pitchfork's top 500 tracks of the 2000s list and putting them head to head in one of the highest quality and competitive rates we've had yet. I could not begin to predict the results personally (though perhaps the first place finisher won't be so difficult, will be interesting to see how high its averag. Radical Redemption Bonanza numba 4. Welcome guys, to the last of Radical reviews, at least until he decides to drop another one in 2 years’ time. This time we take a look at the freshly released, 2017 album of Radical Redemption, titled The Road To Redemption. I am going into this knowing only around half of the tracks from previous releases and previews, so this is gonna be an exciting adventure for sure. Let’s get into it shall we?

Edge Effects Áine O’Dywer presented in collaboration with Counterflows This a complete list of albums, EPs, mixtapes, and other releases by current and former members of Doomtree, through the end of 2016.

This list intentionally does not include: Radio edits Guest appearances Individual tracks produced by Doomtree members for other artists Remixes done by Doomtree membe. This is my first post attempt, forgive me for the lack of flare. This list is incomplete. Not everything on it will be available for caps.

I wrote this quite some time ago for /r/music, thought it was suitable to post here as well! Some obvious choices, some hipster choices. Michael Jackson, the king of pop, had an unprecedented and unrepeated impact on the world of music and entertainment. His songs and videos are part of global culture and among the most recognizable pieces of art in the world.
